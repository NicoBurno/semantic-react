# Semantic React

### NOTE: THIS PROJECT IS EXPERIMENTAL.

Repository for my current work porting the majority of Semantic UI to React Components. 

#### Issues

ESLint for React is currently broken for elements created via `React.createElement` so much of the Prop-Type warnings are broken.

#### Elements
Complete but no tests and no documentation (outside of Button). Probably missing some props.

### Views
* Card - Complete. Needs testing and docs.
* Grid - Incomplete, needs to be updated to current render API.
* Menu - Relatively Complete. Needs testing and docs.

### Modules
* Accordion - Complete but using a dated render API. Needs substantial testing and docs.
* Animate - Very hacky. Needs rewrite.
* Checkbox - Relatively Complete. Needs testing and docs.
* Dimmer - Relatively Complete. Needs testing and docs.
* Dropdown - `Select` complete, but `DropdownMenu` hasn't been implemented. Needs substantial testing and docs.
