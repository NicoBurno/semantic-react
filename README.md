# Semantic React

This project is a complete Semantic UI (SUI) to React. Currently, the majority of SUI has been ported to React however, much of the components are still untested. Major issues going forward include testing, documentation and various enhancements.

## Contributions
The project is currently in its infancy, however, much of the porting is complete. If you would like to contribute to the project, fork and follow the instructions below:

### Installation
```
npm install
npm start
```

**NOTE:** If you are using Windows you'll need to `npm run start:win` due to Windows syntax for setting environmental variables.

This will launch the development documentation. Any modifications to components requires that you re-run `npm run docs:gen`. This is an automated tool that generates props documentation.

### Releases
Presently the only public release is well-behind the current master. The current plan is to complete testing and documentation for all components prior to an official first release.

Depending on your interest, an excellent place to begin contributing is the [High priority issues](https://github.com/hallister/semantic-react/labels/Priority%3A%20High).
